This repository contains the necessary files for simulating DJI Matrice 100 robot in Gazebo. Thanks to [caochao39](https://github.com/caochao39/hku_m100_description) for opensourcing its initial work. I have added two main features on top of his study:

* 3DOF Gimbal that can be commanded by a Gazebo plugin.
* A Simple UAV Controller that is emulating the dji_sdk topics.
